# Anypoint Provider

The Anypoint provider provides resources to interact with a Mulesoft's Anypoint Platform API.

It is not recommended to use your own account for management of your actions. A user specific to
Terraform is recommended. You can use a Connected App also. Two-factor authentication is not supported in the provider.

This project is not an official Mulesoft product, it is an open-source initiative that is maintained by a group of architects 👨‍⚕️ and consultants 🧑‍🔧 at Mulesoft. It implements the Anypoint Platform's terraform provider.

Any contribution is welcome. If you're interested in this project, please get in touch 📧.
