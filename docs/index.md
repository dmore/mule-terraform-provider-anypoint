## Schema

To use the anypoint provider, you either need a **connected app** (which uses the client_id and client_secret) or a registered **user** (username and password).
We recommand using a **user** as the **connected app** has some limitations on some use cases. In fact, some resources cannot be used with **connected apps**. 



### Optional

- **client_id** (String, Sensitive)
- **client_secret** (String, Sensitive)
- **password** (String, Sensitive)
- **username** (String, Sensitive)
