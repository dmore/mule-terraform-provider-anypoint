    membership_type = ""    #Include the group access mappings that grant the provided membership type By default, all group access mappings are returned
    identity_type   = ""    #A search string to use for case-insensitive partial matches on external group name
    member_ids      = ""    #Include the members of the team that have ids in this list
    search          = ""    #Maximum records to retrieve per request.
    offset          = 0     #The number of records to omit from the response.
    limit           = 200   #Maximum records to retrieve per request.
